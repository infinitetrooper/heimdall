# Heimdall: Sing Colour

Welcome to **Heimdall**, where your world's colors become the symphony of your day! ðŸŒˆðŸŽ¶

**What's Heimdall?**
Heimdall is not just an app; it's a magical portal that turns the mundane into the extraordinary. It's like having a rainbow that hums and a sunset that sings. We take colors and turn them into music - because why shouldn't life be a musical?

**Features:**
- **ISO-Tunes**: Watch in awe as Heimdall transforms camera ISO levels into a live concert. The brighter the light, the merrier the melody.
- **Colorful Compositions**: Snap a photo, and Heimdall divides it into 8 segments, each playing a different note based on its color. Ever wondered what your lunch sounds like in C major? Wonder no more!
- **Toggle-Tunes**: With a tap, start and stop the music. Because even maestros need a break.

**How to Use:**
1. Open Heimdall.
2. Point your camera at something colorful.
3. Tap to capture the image.
4. Listen as Heimdall serenades you with the hidden melodies of colors.
5. Toggle the ISO-tunes on and off, because youâ€™re the conductor here.
6. Laugh, because lifeâ€™s too short not to have an app that turns colors into music.

**Fun Fact:**
Why "Heimdall"? In Norse mythology, Heimdall is the ever-vigilant guardian of the Bifrost Bridge. Similarly, our app guards the bridge between sight and sound, connecting two worlds in a way you've never experienced before!

**Disclaimer:**
Heimdall may cause sudden bursts of joy, unexpected dancing, and the realization that every little thing has its own soundtrack. User discretion is advised for quiet libraries and serious board meetings.
